        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.content
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f"HTTP Error :: {errh}")
        return None
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f"Error Connecting :: {errc}")
        return None
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f"Timeout Error :: {errt}")
        return None
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"Something went wrong :: {err}")
        return None

def main():
    url = "https://example.com/file.zip"
    file_content = download_file(url)
    if file_content is not None:
        with open("file.zip", "wb") as file:
            file.write(file_content)
